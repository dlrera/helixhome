Conclusion
The HelixIntel CMMS Platform demonstrates strong core functionality in authentication, navigation, asset management, and dashboard features. The user experience for basic operations is smooth and responsive, with excellent keyboard navigation support.

However, the Templates page has a critical accessibility error that prevents it from rendering, blocking all template-related testing. This must be addressed immediately as templates appear to be a core feature of the maintenance system.

Once the Templates issue is resolved and error handling is improved, the platform should provide a solid foundation for home maintenance management.

Final Recommendation: Fix critical Template page bug before production release, then complete remaining UX tests.
