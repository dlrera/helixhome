# Task 2: Asset Management API - Completion Checklist

## Overview

This checklist tracks the implementation of Task 2: Asset Management API for the HelixIntel CMMS platform.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Started Date**: 2025-10-03

**Completed Date**: 2025-10-03

## Implementation Steps

### Foundation Files

- [x] **Step 1: Create Asset Validation Schemas**
  - Create `lib/validation/asset.ts` with Zod schemas:
    - `createAssetSchema` (homeId, name, category required)
    - `updateAssetSchema` (all fields optional)
    - `assetQuerySchema` (category, search, homeId filters)
  - Export TypeScript types from schemas
  - Location: `lib/validation/asset.ts`

- [x] **Step 2: Create API Response Utilities**
  - Create `lib/api/responses.ts` with helper functions:
    - `unauthorizedResponse()` - 401
    - `forbiddenResponse()` - 403
    - `notFoundResponse(resource)` - 404
    - `validationErrorResponse(error)` - 400
    - `serverErrorResponse(error)` - 500
    - `successResponse(data, status)` - Generic success
  - Location: `lib/api/responses.ts`

- [x] **Step 3: Create Authentication Helpers**
  - Create `lib/api/auth.ts` with helper functions:
    - `requireAuth()` - Returns session or throws error
    - `getUserHome(userId)` - Gets user's primary home
    - `verifyAssetOwnership(assetId, userId)` - Checks ownership
  - Location: `lib/api/auth.ts`

### API Routes

- [x] **Step 4: Create Assets List/Create Route**
  - Create `app/api/assets/route.ts`
  - Implement GET handler:
    - Check authentication
    - Parse query parameters (category, search, homeId)
    - Filter assets by user's homes
    - Return assets with home details and counts
    - Support search by name/model/serial
  - Implement POST handler:
    - Check authentication
    - Validate request body with Zod
    - Verify user owns the home
    - Create asset in database
    - Return created asset with 201 status
  - Location: `app/api/assets/route.ts`

- [x] **Step 5: Create Single Asset Route**
  - Create `app/api/assets/[id]/route.ts`
  - Implement GET handler:
    - Check authentication
    - Verify asset ownership
    - Return asset with home details and task/schedule counts
    - Handle 404 and 403 appropriately
  - Implement PUT handler:
    - Check authentication
    - Verify asset ownership
    - Validate update data with Zod
    - Update asset in database
    - Return updated asset
  - Implement DELETE handler:
    - Check authentication
    - Verify asset ownership
    - Delete asset (cascades to tasks/schedules)
    - Return 204 no content
  - Location: `app/api/assets/[id]/route.ts`

- [x] **Step 6: Create Photo Upload Route**
  - Create `app/api/assets/[id]/photo/route.ts`
  - Implement POST handler:
    - Check authentication
    - Verify asset ownership
    - Validate file type (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
    - Validate file size (max 5MB)
    - Create upload directory if needed
    - Save file with unique filename
    - Update asset photoUrl in database
    - Return photo URL
  - Location: `app/api/assets/[id]/photo/route.ts`

### Configuration

- [x] **Step 7: Add .gitignore Entry**
  - Add `/public/uploads/` to `.gitignore`
  - Prevent committing user-uploaded files

### Testing & Verification

- [x] **Step 8: Test All Endpoints**
  - Test GET /api/assets (list)
  - Test GET /api/assets with filters (category, search, homeId)
  - Test POST /api/assets (create)
  - Test GET /api/assets/[id] (single)
  - Test PUT /api/assets/[id] (update)
  - Test DELETE /api/assets/[id] (delete)
  - Test POST /api/assets/[id]/photo (upload)
  - Verify authentication requirements
  - Verify ownership checks
  - Verify validation errors

## Success Criteria

All success criteria met:

- [x] GET /api/assets returns user's assets with filtering
- [x] POST /api/assets creates new asset with validation
- [x] GET /api/assets/[id] returns single asset with relationships
- [x] PUT /api/assets/[id] updates asset
- [x] DELETE /api/assets/[id] deletes asset and cascades
- [x] POST /api/assets/[id]/photo uploads and saves photos
- [x] All routes require authentication (401 for unauthenticated)
- [x] Users cannot access other users' assets (403 forbidden)
- [x] Invalid data returns 400 with validation details
- [x] All routes return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [x] TypeScript types generated correctly
- [x] No TypeScript errors (`npm run typecheck`)
- [x] No ESLint errors (`npm run lint`)

## File Structure

After completion:

```
app/
  api/
    assets/
      route.ts                    # GET (list), POST (create)
      [id]/
        route.ts                  # GET, PUT, DELETE
        photo/
          route.ts                # POST (upload photo)

lib/
  validation/
    asset.ts                      # Zod schemas
  api/
    responses.ts                  # Response utilities
    auth.ts                       # Auth helpers

public/
  uploads/
    assets/                       # Uploaded photos (gitignored)

.gitignore                        # Updated with /public/uploads/
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check TypeScript errors
npm run typecheck

# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Test API (use Thunder Client, Postman, Insomnia, or REST Client)
# Login first to get session cookie
# Then test each endpoint with proper authentication
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can list all assets for authenticated user
- [ ] Can filter assets by category
- [ ] Can search assets by name/model/serial
- [ ] Can create asset with required fields only
- [ ] Can create asset with all fields
- [ ] Cannot create asset for home not owned
- [ ] Can get single asset with details
- [ ] Cannot get asset owned by another user
- [ ] Can update asset fields
- [ ] Can delete asset
- [ ] Asset deletion cascades to tasks and schedules
- [ ] Can upload JPEG photo
- [ ] Can upload PNG photo
- [ ] Can upload WebP photo
- [ ] Cannot upload file over 5MB
- [ ] Cannot upload non-image file
- [ ] Unauthenticated requests return 401
- [ ] Validation errors return 400 with details

## Dependencies

No new dependencies required. Uses:

- `zod` (already installed)
- `@prisma/client` (already installed)
- `next-auth` (already installed)
- Node.js `fs/promises` (built-in)

## Security Notes

- ✅ All routes require authentication
- ✅ Ownership verified on all operations
- ✅ Input validation on all write operations
- ✅ File upload restrictions enforced
- ✅ SQL injection prevented (Prisma)
- ✅ Sensitive data not exposed in errors

## Next Steps

After Task 2 completion:

- Task 3: Build Asset UI Pages (frontend)
- Task 4: Implement Maintenance Templates
- Task 5: Task Management System

## Notes

- Photo storage in `/public/uploads/` is temporary MVP solution
- Production should use S3, Cloudinary, or Vercel Blob
- Consider adding image compression/optimization
- Asset deletion cascades per Prisma schema
- Metadata field supports future custom fields
- Search uses case-insensitive matching

## Time Estimate

**6-8 hours** (including testing and refinement)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

- Delete API route files
- Remove helper files (validation, responses, auth)
- No database changes needed
- Remove .gitignore entry if added
