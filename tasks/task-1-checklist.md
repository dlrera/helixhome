  - Location: `prisma/schema.prisma` lines 16-64

- [x] **Step 2: Add Home Model**
  - Added Home model with userId, name, address fields
  - Includes relations to User, Asset, and Task
  - Location: `prisma/schema.prisma` lines 121-134

- [x] **Step 3: Add Asset Model**
  - Added Asset model with homeId, category, model/serial numbers, warranty tracking
  - Includes relations to Home, Task, and RecurringSchedule
  - Indexes on homeId and category
  - Location: `prisma/schema.prisma` lines 136-156

- [x] **Step 4: Add MaintenanceTemplate Model**
  - Added MaintenanceTemplate model for pre-built maintenance tasks
  - Includes frequency, difficulty, duration, instructions fields
  - Supports both system templates and custom templates
  - Location: `prisma/schema.prisma` lines 158-175

- [x] **Step 5: Add Task Model**
  - Added Task model with homeId, assetId, templateId references
  - Includes priority, status, due dates, completion tracking
  - Relations to Home, Asset, MaintenanceTemplate, and Notification
  - Indexes on homeId, assetId, status, and dueDate
  - Location: `prisma/schema.prisma` lines 177-201

- [x] **Step 6: Add RecurringSchedule Model**
  - Added RecurringSchedule for automated task generation
  - Links templates to assets with frequency settings
  - Tracks nextDueDate and isActive status
  - Location: `prisma/schema.prisma` lines 203-218

- [x] **Step 7: Add Notification Model**
  - Added Notification model for task reminders
  - Supports EMAIL, PUSH, and SMS types
  - Tracks status (PENDING, SENT, FAILED) and sentAt timestamp
  - Location: `prisma/schema.prisma` lines 220-236

- [x] **Step 8: Update User Model**
  - Added relations to Home and Notification models
  - Location: `prisma/schema.prisma` lines 77-78

### Database Migration

- [x] **Step 9: Create Migration**
  - Command executed: `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_cmms_models`
  - Migration created: `prisma/migrations/20251003175153_add_cmms_models/migration.sql`
  - Migration applied successfully
  - Prisma Client regenerated

### Seed Data

- [x] **Step 10: Update Seed Script**
  - Replaced `prisma/seed.ts` with comprehensive seed data
  - Added imports for all enums and types
  - Included 20 pre-built maintenance templates
  - Created sample home, assets, and tasks

- [x] **Step 11: Run Seed Script**
  - Command executed: `npm run db:seed`
  - Successfully seeded:
    - 2 users (admin@example.com, test@example.com)
    - 1 home (Main Residence)
    - 3 assets (Furnace, Water Heater, Refrigerator)
    - 20 maintenance templates
    - 3 pending tasks

## Success Criteria

All success criteria met:

- ✅ Migration runs without errors
- ✅ All 7 new models created (Home, Asset, MaintenanceTemplate, Task, RecurringSchedule, Notification)
- ✅ All 7 enums created (AssetCategory, Frequency, Difficulty, Priority, TaskStatus, NotificationType, NotificationStatus)
- ✅ Seed script creates all required data
- ✅ TypeScript types generated successfully
- ✅ No foreign key constraint errors

## Verification

To verify the implementation:

```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run typecheck

# View database in Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio

# Regenerate Prisma Client (if needed)
npx prisma generate
```

## Seed Data Summary

**Users**:

- admin@example.com / admin123
- test@example.com / test123

**Home**: Main Residence (123 Main St, Springfield, IL 62701)

**Assets**:

1. Main Furnace (HVAC) - XC95M-100
2. Water Heater (Plumbing) - AO Smith 50G
3. Kitchen Refrigerator (Appliance) - LG LFXS26973S

**Maintenance Templates**: 20 templates covering:

- HVAC: Change Filter, Service System
- Electrical: Test Smoke Detectors, Test GFCI Outlets
- Appliances: Clean Range Hood, Clean Refrigerator Coils, Clean Dryer Vent, Check Washing Machine Hoses, Clean Garbage Disposal
- Plumbing: Flush Water Heater, Test Sump Pump, Winterize Outdoor Faucets, Run Water in Unused Drains, Check Water Softener Salt
- Outdoor: Clean Gutters, Seal Deck/Fence
- Structural: Check Roof and Attic, Clean Chimney, Clean Window Wells
- Other: Inspect Fire Extinguisher

**Tasks**:

1. Change HVAC Filter (due in 3 days, HIGH priority)
2. Flush Water Heater (due in 30 days, MEDIUM priority)
3. Test Smoke Detectors (due in 7 days, HIGH priority)

## Next Steps

Task 1 is complete. Ready to proceed with:

- Task 2: Create Asset Management API routes
- Task 3: Build Asset UI pages
- Task 4: Implement Maintenance Templates

## Notes

- SQLite stores JSON as strings - use `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`
- All foreign keys use appropriate cascade/setNull behaviors
- Indexes added for common query patterns
- Default values set for enums and booleans
- All models include createdAt/updatedAt timestamps
