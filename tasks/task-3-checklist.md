## Performance Considerations

- Server-side data fetching for initial load
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Lazy loading for images in grid
- Debounced search input (if needed)
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate

## Security Notes

- âœ… All pages require authentication
- âœ… Server components verify ownership
- âœ… API routes validate ownership
- âœ… File upload validates type and size
- âœ… Form inputs validated client and server
- âœ… Protected routes redirect to signin

## Next Steps

After Task 3 completion:

- **Task 4**: Implement Maintenance Templates
- **Task 5**: Task Management System
- **Task 6**: Dashboard Enhancement

## Notes

- Use existing API routes from Task 2
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns
- Match existing auth patterns
- Use TailwindCSS v4 syntax
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Server components for data, client for interactivity
- Toast notifications via shadcn/ui toast hook

## Time Estimate

**12-16 hours** (including components, pages, testing, and styling)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

- Delete created page files
- Delete created component files
- Delete asset-helpers utility
- No database changes in this task
- No API changes in this task
