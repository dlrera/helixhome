   - Task (linked to Home, Asset, and MaintenanceTemplate)
   - RecurringSchedule (linked to Asset and MaintenanceTemplate)
   - Notification (linked to User and Task)
3. Add required enums: AssetCategory, Frequency, Difficulty, Priority, TaskStatus, NotificationType, NotificationStatus
4. Run migration: `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_cmms_models`
5. Update `/prisma/seed.ts` to include:

---

### Important Notes for Coding Agent

1. **Always check authentication** - Use `getServerSession(authOptions)` in all API routes
2. **Follow existing patterns** - Look at existing code in auth routes for patterns
3. **Use existing components** - Don't recreate what's in `/components/ui/`
4. **Test incrementally** - Verify each feature works before moving on
5. **Seed realistic data** - Make the demo compelling with good sample data
6. **Mobile-first** - Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
7. **Use transactions** - When creating related records (asset + tasks)
8. **Handle errors gracefully** - Show user-friendly error messages

---

### Environment Variables to Add

Add to `.env` file:

```
# Email Service (choose one)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here
# OR
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_key_here

# File Storage (for production)
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret

# Cron Secret (for Vercel Cron)
CRON_SECRET=random_string_here
```

---

### Completion Definition

The MVP is complete when:
