# Tooling and frameworks

- Use pnpm over npm

# Best Practices

- Don't leave unused imports anywhere
- Don't mock data in the UI, always make the API return it
- Don't mock data in the API, always seed the in-memory database to populate data
- Don't use `useEffect` for side effects, use `useMutation` or `useQuery` instead
