## Best Practices

### Getting Started

1. Start with critical safety templates (smoke detectors, GFCI outlets)
2. Add HVAC filter changes for better air quality
3. Apply seasonal templates based on your climate
4. Gradually add more templates as you get comfortable

### Frequency Tips

- Adjust frequencies based on usage and manufacturer recommendations
- More frequent = better prevention but more work
- Consider seasonal factors (e.g., more frequent HVAC filter changes during high-use seasons)
- Start conservative and adjust based on actual needs

### Organization

- Apply templates to all similar assets at once
- Keep schedules synchronized for related tasks
- Group seasonal tasks together
- Review and adjust schedules quarterly

## Troubleshooting

### Template Already Applied

- Each template can only be applied once per asset
- To change frequency, edit the existing schedule
- To restart, delete and reapply

### Missing Suggested Templates

- Suggestions are based on asset category
- Ensure your asset has the correct category set
- Already applied templates won't appear in suggestions

### Tasks Not Generating

- Check that the schedule is active (not paused)
- Verify the next due date is correct
- Ensure the template is still active in the system

### Can't Find a Template

- Use the search bar for specific terms
- Try different category filters
- Check if the template might be under a different name
- Some specialized tasks may require custom task creation

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Don't overwhelm yourself - begin with 3-5 essential templates
2. **Be Realistic**: Choose frequencies you can actually maintain
3. **Use Reminders**: Enable notifications for due tasks
4. **Track Completion**: Mark tasks complete to maintain accurate schedules
5. **Adjust as Needed**: Modify frequencies based on real-world experience
6. **Seasonal Planning**: Apply seasonal templates before the season starts
7. **Professional Tasks**: Don't skip professional maintenance - schedule service calls
8. **Document Issues**: Note problems during maintenance for future reference
